# Review
ROS stands for the Robot Operating System, and although it is not technically an OS, it is a well-designed framework that supports multiple programming languages and robot systems. The versatility of ROS is provided by its abstract communication layer composed of nodes, topics, and services. ROS2 is the second iteration of ROS, and was designed to make ROS more accessible and portable, with a new build system and increased functionality. You are free to read more about these changes on the [developer site](https://design.ros2.org/articles/changes.html).

# Making a package
We will be following the [tutorial on package creation](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package/) provided by the ROS wiki.
