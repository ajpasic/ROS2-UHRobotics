# ROS2-UHRobotics
A wiki for beginners learning ROS, the Robot Operating System

This repo is meant to be a supplement to the ROS2 workshop at the University of Houston. Many people taking this workshop have no prior experience with ROS, so there is a wiki detailing what ROS is, why you should bother learning it, how to install it, and how to use it. This repo is pretty sparse at the moment, but hopefully by the end of the semester it'll be full of neat examples, helpful tips, and articulate explanations of the many facets of ROS.
